# A list of Perun roles that are loaded to the database
perun_roles: []

# A list of Perun policies that are loaded to the PerunPoliciesContainer.
#
# Name of each policy starts with method name (usually), continues with parameter's types (except PerunSession)
# and ends with "policy". Between each of these parts are underscores.
# In scenarios where one method needs more policies, or there are conflicts between policy names,
# optional word with a dash at the end can be used before the method name.
# Example: filter-getAllMembers_Group_policy
#
# Each policy is composed of two parts.
# The first one is called policy_roles, which contains privileged roles for this policy.
# The second one is include_policies which contains policies which add their policy_roles to this policy.
#
# The policy_roles is a list of maps, where the relation between list entries is logical OR
# and the relation between map entries is logical AND.
# Each map element contains role name as a key and object type as a value (value is optional).
# This specifies that a particular role has privileges in the policy with a connection to the type of object.
# The actual object (or objects) is then passed in the code where the evaluation is called.
# When there are passed more objects with the specified type, the principal has to have assigned a role to all of them.
# When there are provided no objects of the specified type, this "role: object type" entry will not be satisfied.
# Example: policy_roles:
#            - VOADMIN: Vo
#            - GROUPADMIN: Group
#              RESOURCEADMIN: Resource
#            - PERUNOBESRVER:
#
# Explanation: The list contains 3 elements. The first element contains a map with one entry,
# the second one with two, and the last one with one. It is enough to satisfy just one element in the list.
# The first map contains one entry where the key is VOADMIN, and the object type is Vo.
# Meaning that to satisfy this entry, the principal has to have role VOADMIN connected with object type Vo,
# where the actual object is passed in the code.
# The second map contains two entries, therefore to satisfy this map, the principal has to be GROUPADMIN on a group
# and RESOURCEADMIN on a resource.
# The last map contains one entry specifying that the principal has to have role PERUNOBSERVER
# but without the connection with any object.
#
# The include_policies is a list of policy names that will be included in the policy.
# Relation between the policy and its included policies is logical OR.
# Meaning that to satisfy the policy, it is enough to either satisfy policy_roles in the policy
# or to satisfy policy_roles for at least one of the included policies.
# Most of the policies are including default_policy, which contains PERUNADMIN's privileges.
# Example: include_policies:
#            - default_policy
#            - getAllVos_policy
#
