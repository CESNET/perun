# Namespace rules which are used to determine, which information is needed
# for each namespace during sponsorship of a new user. Creation of service account also
# uses provided attributes to determine if generating login is required.
# These information are generally used to create an external account.
#
#
# default_email - this field determines, which email will be set as a preferred attribute, for the generated sponsored
#                 user. If this value is not specified, it fallbacks to 'no-reply@perun-aai.org'
# csv_gen_header - this field defines the csv format used for parsing data for sponsored user.
# csv_gen_placeholder - this field contains placeholder for the used csv format.
# csv_gen_header_description - this field is used in GUI, it is a user-friendly description of the CSV format, e.g.:
#                              'Firstname;Lastname;Email;Note;', used for sponsorship.
# required_attributes - fields from the SponsoredUserData class, which are required for the given namespace during the
#                       creation of a sponsorship. Allowed values are fields of the SponsoredUserData class. This
#                       should be mainly used in GUI to determine, which items should be visible in the dialog. But, it
#                       is also used in the backend to validate the RPC input data. The value of these fields has to
#                       be provided and only these fields should be used in the namespace's implementation. The only
#                       exception is the 'password' which doesn't have to be provided, if the user will receive an
#                       activation link. If 'login' is missing in required or optional attributes, it tries to generate
#                       it for sponsored or service user.
# optional_attributes - fields from the SponsoredUserData class, which are optional for the given namespace during the
#                       creation of a sponsorship. Allowed values are fields of the SponsoredUserData class. This is
#                       used only in GUI! It doesn't affect anything on the backend, since the optional attributes are
#                       limited by the actual fields of the SponsoredUserData class. These values can be omitted and it
#                       should be still possible to create a sponsored user.
#
# Currently allowed fields are:
#  * guestName
#  * firstName
#  * lastName
#  * titleBefore
#  * titleAfter
#  * email
#  * password
#  * login
#
# If some namespace would require an additional information, some steps are needed to be done:
#  1.A new field has to be added to the SponsoredUserData class
#  2 GUI has to edit the dialog accordingly
#  3.This configuration has to be updated for the namespaces which need this new field
#  4.Update the list of the currently allowed fields above.
