/**
 * Processing pool for processing PerunBeans as jobs.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * You can put new waiting jobs in it and take waiting jobs to set them as running, and then remove them after work with
 * them is finished. Jobs in processing pool are unique and can't be added if they are already in list of waiting jobs
 * or in set of running jobs. New waiting job can skip order and be putted as first in the list of waiting jobs.
 * <p>
 * Note: this class doesn't run any task scheduler, it just provides structures and functionality to manipulate with
 * these structures used for processing job from the pool of waiting jobs.
