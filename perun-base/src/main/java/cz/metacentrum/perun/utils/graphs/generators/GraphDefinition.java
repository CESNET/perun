/**
 * <b>Class that defines relations in graph.</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * New relations can be added with method 'addEntitiesData' where the expected format
 * is a {@link Map} of {@link T} entities where every entity has a {@link Set} of target entities.
 * In other words, there is an oriented Edge between enetity and its target entities.
 * After specifying entities data, you have to set edge type with method 'withEdgeType'.
 * <p>
 * Example: graphDefinition.addEntitiesData(data).withEdgeType(GraphEdge.Type.BOLD);
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * New relations can also be added with method 'addEntity'. After specifying the entity,
 * you have to set target entities with method 'withTargetEntities'. After that you must set
 * the graph edge type.
 * <p>
 * Example: graphDefinition.addEntity(entity).withTargetEntities(targetEntities).withEdgeType(GraphEdge.Type.BOLD);
