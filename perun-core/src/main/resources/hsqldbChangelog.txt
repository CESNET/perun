-- Versions must be separated by empty lines, version number should consist of three numbers with dots between, f.e. 3.0.1 is ok, 3.1 or 3.1.1.1 is not.
-- Directly under version number should be version commands. They will be executed in the order they are written here.
-- Comments are prefixed with -- and can be written only between version blocks, that means not in the lines with commands. They have to be at the start of the line.
